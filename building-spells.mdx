There are 2 ways to start building a spell: 

#### 1\. Using the Spell Studio

To access the Spell Studio, you can click the ‚ÄúNew Spell‚Äù button from the [Home](https://respell.ai/home) page or [Library](https://respell.ai/library) page.

From here, you‚Äôll be in the our Spell Studio! This is a drag & drop no-code editor. To get started, click on a ‚Äòinput‚Äô block and attach it to a model and output. You can learn more about each block type in the [Block Types ü™Ñ](/docs/block-types) section.

All the blocks in our editor fit into one of four categories categories: [Logic blocks](/docs/logic-blocks), [Data blocks](/docs/data-blocks), [Model blocks](/docs/model-blocks), and [Integration blocks](/docs/integration-blocks).

#### 2\. Duplicating a spell or template from the Respell Explore Page

You can click on the "Duplicate" button for any public spell on the [Respell Explore Page](https://respell.ai/explore). Duplicating makes a copy of that spell in your Library, from where you can edit or build on top of it!
