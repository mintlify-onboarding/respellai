#### Input Block

The input block is used for every spell. When building a spell, you'll need some sort of data input or instruction or prompt - this is the block for that! It can accept text, image, audio, or file input. This type will depend on what block you connect to it.

Input Blocks can be either dynamic (entered by the user) or fixed value (set to a constant value by the spell maker; can't be changed by the user).

#### Output Block

The output block, similar to the input block, can support text, image, audio, and file types. The outputs will be shown after a spell run is complete on the spell page!

#### Combine Text Block

The combine text block is best used to create an output using various inputs as variables. It's especially helpful for creating a prompt. Here's an example of its use in our Resume Ranker template.
