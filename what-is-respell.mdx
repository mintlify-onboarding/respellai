title: "What is Respell?"
---

Respell is a platform where you can _explore_ and _create_ spells. Spells are what we call automations that are powered by AI (artificial intelligence). These automations can be used to power **any** workflow or app!

It’s called a spell because its supposed to feel like magic! ✨

To _explore_ spells, check out the [Respell Explore Page](https://respell.ai/explore), where you'll find spells created by the Respell team & community. The [Respell Explore Page](https://respell.ai/explore) has a variety of spells from filtering through resumés all the way to creating beats from an album cover. 

Browse the [Respell Explore Page](https://respell.ai/explore) for inspiration on what you can create with Respell! Also check out the next page to learn about [Using Spells](/using-spells).

To _create_ spells, you have 2 options: 

1. Use the spell studio to build from scratch for ultimate flexibility.
2. Duplicate a public spell from the explore page, and build on top of that! The spells on the [Respell Explore Page](https://respell.ai/explore) are made by community members. They also include official templates made by the Respell team!
